# TSP
Travelling Salesman: A Classic MIP Problem

A salesman starts from location 1 and has to visit n â‰  1 locations (so including the starting point there are n locations) and return to his starting point. He must visit each location exactly once. The cost of moving from location i to location j is cij (time, monetary cost, etc).

Assume there are 9 locations in the TSP problem. The salesman has to start in one location and return to that location after visiting all the locations. The distances (or monetary cost) of moving between any two locations is given in the following table. Find the optimal TSP route. See DATA.xlsx file.
